# Cab Booking System for Data Analysis

A comprehensive project showcasing a Cab Booking Analytics system engineered with SQL to deliver actionable business insights from booking data. The repository features a normalized database schema, practical query examples, and demonstrates how data-driven decisions are made in a transportation business context.

## Description

- Developed a normalized database schema for cab bookings, drivers, and trips.
- Used SQL queries to analyze driver performance, track revenue trends, and identify booking patterns.
- Explored operational efficiency through database analytics for real-world scenarios.

## Learnings

- Designed relational databases from scratch for structured business data.
- Practiced SQL techniques: date filtering, aggregation, joins, and conditional logic.
- Applied SQL queries to address practical business questions and optimize operations.

## SQL Techniques Used

- Schema normalization and table creation for robust data storage.
- Date filtering to analyze bookings by time periods.
- Aggregation queries for revenue and performance metrics.
- JOINs to combine data on drivers, trips, and bookings for comprehensive analysis.

## Requirements

- SQL-compatible database system (MySQL or similar).
- MySQL Workbench or any preferred SQL editor.

## Getting Started

- Download or clone this repository.
- Review the schema creation `.sql` file to set up the database.
- Run analytics queries on sample data to explore business insights.
- Modify queries to adjust for your own data or learning needs.

## Optionals & Troubleshooting

- Ensure tables are created in the correct order to satisfy foreign key dependencies.
- For large sample data, verify query performance and apply indexes as needed.
